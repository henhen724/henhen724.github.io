<!-- My name is Henry Hunt; I am 1st year graduate student in the physics Ph.D. program at Stanford. As an undergraduate, I worked in accelerator physics under my advisor [Sergei Nagaitsev](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/sergei-nagaitsev/) on creating a new mathematical model for non-linear beam echo, which is a rephasing phenomena in many-body near linear classical mechanics. In
addition, I programed the control software for the bakeout of the MAGIS 100 experiment at Fermilab. For my Ph.D. research, I am still doing my rotations (meaning I have not settled into a single lab yet), but I am starting in Professor [Ben Lev's](https://levlab.stanford.edu/) on the Many Body Cavity QED (Rb cQED) experiment using a confocal cavity and Rubidium atoms. -->
